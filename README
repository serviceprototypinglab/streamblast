Streamblast: Fast entity extraction and transformation
for IoT, Fog and Cloud applications
------------------------------------------------------

Streamblast works like Logstash or Fluentd, just with higher
performance. Instead of using an ELK/EFK stack, with Streamblast one can
set up ESK or PSG stacks that are blazingly fast. Use Streamblast for
log aggregation and analytics, IoT message aggregation and processing,
and message stream filtering in continuum computing scenarios.

ESK:
 Streamblast (attribute extraction + JSON formatting)
 -> Elasticsearch (NoSQL database) -> Kibana (visualisation)

PSG:
 Streamblast (attribute extraction + JSON formatting)
 -> PostgreSQL (SQL database) -> Grafana (visualisation) 

Streamblast is implemented in C in two flavours depending on performance
and flexibility requirements: A single-attribute and a multi-attribute
variant.

Future plans are a merge of both variants into one executable with
appropriate getopt parameter parsing, and the support of more stacks
such as FaaS for scalable message processing in the cloud and Tile38 for
scalable geolocation processing from sensor deployments.

Installation:
- make sure pcre2-dev is installed
- type `make'

Test:
- Minimal test data in the syntactic form of a firewall log is included
  in the `data' folder
